If you enjoy travelling to Japan and have only a short-term tourist visa, you are UNOFFICIALLY alloted a total of 180 days within a rolling 365 day window. In all honesty, Japanese customs have the final decision on whether you enter or not. However, you are alot more likely to raise eyebrows if you spend more than 180 days within the rolling window because customs officials begin to assume you may be trying to reside and or make money in Japan illegally. 

This script can be used so that you can get a better idea of how much time you can spend in Japan to limit how much of the custom official eyebrows get raised.
